There are two ways to install. First run the following
sh naclbuild.sh
sh naclgoodies.sh
sh configure.sh

then cd into the build/work directory and run make. Note that make clean
nukes the makefile: this inconvence will be fixed in a later release.

If you have Nacl already on your machine you may skip running naclbuild
provided that the headers are in build/include and the libraries are in
build/lib. You must also write

compiler = $compiler_options_for_nacl

in compiler in build, then run configure.sh and the makefile as above.
