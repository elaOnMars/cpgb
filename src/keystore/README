This is just a basic email to public keys store.
PKIs are a tough problem, so we punt and use this keystore to support
multiple distribution mechanisms. Think of this as an address book
for keys.

Your private keys should be stored outside it to avoid dumb mistakes.

We support keytypes. Keys can be signing, encryption, or authorization
keys (really signing keys). To send a message requires knowing an encryption
key. Signing keys are used for verifying signatures. Authorization keys
sign information relating to other keys associated with the email address.

I'm currently working out the details of making this keystore work.
Right now it seems clear to me that we want to have multiple personal keys
for different uses: signing releases, signing email, SSH, etc. We also
trust keys in different ways.

Ideally this would support all of that. But that's a bit tricky.
Instead I'll focus on making it easy to find keys and why we should
trust key<->name linkages.
