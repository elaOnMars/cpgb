This is just a basic email to public keys store.
PKIs are a tough problem, so we punt and use this keystore to support
multiple distribution mechanisms. Think of this as an address book
for keys.

Your private keys should be stored outside it to avoid dumb mistakes.

We support keytypes. Keys can be signing, encryption, or authorization
keys (really signing keys). To send a message requires knowing an encryption
key. Signing keys are used for verifying signatures. Authorization keys
sign information relating to other keys associated with the email address.

And in true unix style it is the dumbest file format concieved by man:
email type key
where key is a hex form of the actual key
email is the email
and type is e for encryption, s for signing, and a for authorization.
